# Paper Submission

## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AUTHORS

For preparation of papers please follow the instructions for authors available at the [Springer LNCS Web page](https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).
The length of each paper including figures and references may not exceed 16 pages.
All papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format. 

<!-- Submission site to be created -->
For submission of papers, please use the EasyChair site at [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2020](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=coine2020)

Submission of a paper should be regarded as an undertaking that, should the paper be accepted, at least one of the authors will attend the workshop to present the work. 

## PROCEEDINGS

Preliminary proceedings will be available before the conference.
They will also be distributed to AAMAS 2020 registrants in electronic form. 

<!-- As with previous COIN workshops, we will have an LNCS postproceedings.
Authors will be invited to submit revised and extended versions of their paper for consideration for a Springer LNCS volume combining the postproceedings of this workshop with those for a second COIN workshop to be held later in 2017.

Revised papers must take into account the discussion held during the workshop; hence, only papers that are presented during the workshop will be considered for inclusion in the post-proceedings volume. -->
